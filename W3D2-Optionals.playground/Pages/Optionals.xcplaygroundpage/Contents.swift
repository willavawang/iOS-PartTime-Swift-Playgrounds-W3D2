//: ## Optionals and nil
//:
//: So far we've glossed over this topic by avoiding optionals. That's good! We try to avoid optionality, because it simplifies our code. But often optionals can't be avoided.
//:
//: First let's start with a conversion that doesn't require optionals. If we have a Double and an Int, and we want to do math with them, the compiler won't let us. This is because we can't add two different types together.

var ratio: Double = 10.0 // ratio is a Double
var count: Int = 20 // count is an Int

// ratio * count // this line does not compile.

//: To get around this we can convert between types. For example, creating a new Double using an Int.

var countDouble = Double(count) // convert count to a Double

ratio * countDouble // now this works!

//:
//: With that kind of conversion in mind, let's say we have a string that contains the characters 1 and 0, e.g. "10". That looks like a number, but it's a string that contains a text representation of a number.
//:
//: If we want to add 1 to our number-containing-string, we need to convert it to a number. We can do that!

var numberString = "10" // a string containing digits
var convertedNum = Double(numberString) //convert numberString to a Double

//: Now look at the type of the variable `convertedNum`. It's not actually a `Double` it's a `Double?`. The question mark at the end of the type indicates that this variable is "optional". That means we might have a double or we might have nothing. This is because, unlike converting an Int to a Double, the conversion between a `String` and a `Double` might fail! It could fail because some strings don't make sense as numbers. How would you convert the string "ðŸ˜Ž" to a `Double`...?
//:
//: Ok so that's not too crazy! Things that can fail return optionals, and their type has a question-mark after it, like `Int?`, things that always work give us back non-optionals (e.g. `Int` without a question-mark). Cool!
//:
//: So now let's try to add 1 to our `convertedNum` variable.

//convertedNum = convertedNum + 1 // uncomment this line!

//: Looks like the compiler doesn't like that! It's giving us a cryptic error about applying binary operators and types and things, and offers the suggestion of adding an exclaimation point!
//:
//: We aren't able to do math with `convertedNum` because while it's easy to say how to add `10` and `1` together, Swift doesn't know how to add maybe-nothing-maybe-10 and `1` together.
//:
//: To use our optional Int, we need to unwrap it. There are a few ways to unwrap variables, and we'll need to know at least two of them.
//:
//: The first and most dangerous way is by adding an exclaimation point. This is called "force unwrapping". It will make the compiler ignore the optional and use the contents of `convertedNum`.  So if `convertedNum` does contain a number, the unwap will succeed.  However, the force-unwrap will crash the Playground if our `numberString` contained something that couldn't be converted to a number.

//: ## Challenge 1
//:
//: Use the example above to write code that tries to convert `inputString` into an `Int`.

var inputString = "hello"
// try to convert inputString to an Int here:
var convertdString = Int(inputString)

//: If you've done everything right you should see "nil" along the right-hand gutter of the playground. This is what we use to represent "nothing". Only optional variables can have a value of `nil`.
//:
//: ## Challenge 2
//:
//: First, uncomment the second line below
//:
//: Next, make the second line below compile by adding a force unwrap.
//:
//: Then, change the string "1" to "ðŸ”¥" and observe how the playground responds (or doesn't respond)

var number = Int("1")
 number! + 1 // uncomment and fix this.


//: In general, force unwrapping is always a risk for a crash, and should be used sparingly and with caution.
//:
//: Don't forget to comment out or fix the broken line above so your code below works.
//:
//: ## Challenge 3
//:
//: The next way to deal with optionals is called "Conditional unwrapping" or sometimes casually called an "if-let". It's **much** safer, and won't break your Playground.
//:
//: The code below uses a conditional unwrap on `number`. This creates a new variable "unwrapped", but only if `number` is *not* nil. If you option click on the variable `unwrapped` you will notice that it is an `Int` not an `Int?`
//:
//: Switch the string we're converting in Challenge 2 to something that succeeds and back to something that fails and observe how different bits of code get run.

if let unwrapped = number {
    // unwrapped exists in this block, and is number unwrapped.
    print("\(unwrapped) is an Int and no longer an Int?")
}else{
    // unwrapped doesn't exist in this block.
    print("number did not unwrap")
}

//: ## Challenge 4
//:
//: Here's an optional variable. Conditionally unwrap and print it if it exists, print "no greeting" if it doesn't exist.

var greeting: String? = "Aloha!"

if let unwrapped = greeting {
    // unwrapped exists in this block, and is number unwrapped.
    print("\(unwrapped)")
}else{
    // unwrapped doesn't exist in this block.
    print("no greeting")
}

//: ## One last thing...
//:
//: Have a look at the following code:

var number1 = 10 // a number
var advancedNumber1 = number1.advanced(by: 10) // advanced by 10, should be 20

var number2 = Int("10") // maybe a number
var advancedNumber2 = number2?.advanced(by: 10) // advanced by 10, should be maybe 20

//: Use option-click to look at all the variables to get clear on their types. Notice that because `number2` is optional, `advancedNumber2` is also optional. What we're doing with `number2` is called optional-chaining. That's the question mark between `number2` and `.advanceBy(10)`. Using this we can call methods (like `advanceBy`) on variables that are optional.
//:
//: There are two important side effects of optional chaining:
//:
//: 1. If `number2`'s value is `nil`, advanceBy will not be run.
//: 2. Even though `advanceBy` always succeeds, since it's not always run, `advancedNumber2` is an optional.


//: ## Summary
//:
//: Optionals are a great way of handling complexity, but you have to understand how to work with them. If you have an optional (e.g. `Double?`) and want to convert it to a non-optional (e.g. `Double`), use an if let statement to safely unwrap it. Avoid using force-unwraps when at all possible, as they make your code less stable and less predictable.
//:
//: Optional chaining allows you to put off unwrapping, but it doesn't avoid it entirely.
